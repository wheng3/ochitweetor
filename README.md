# Final Assessment
Assessment Dates: **12 October 2017** (Friday) - **19 October 2017** (Thursday)

Location: Remote/On-Site

## How it works?

### 1. Build a Rails app based on one of the following ideas: 

* Trip Advisor Clone
* Pinterest Clone
* Image Gallery (e.g. Flickr/Instagram)
* Todo List (with picture uploads)
* Business Operations App (e.g. Sweet Process)
* Health-related Apps
* Science-related Apps
* Recipe Book
* Suggestion App on where to eat/date/have group outings/etc (choose one)
* Auction App
* Investment Calculator
* A Second-Hand Buy and Sell App (e.g. Carousell, mudah.com.my, imsold)
* Game: Hangman (multiplayer)
* Game: Card trading (multiplayer)
* any other idea you can think of

Your app must include *at least* the following 5 features:

1. A user authentication feature built from scratch (sign up/sign in), i.e. no using `clearance`/`devise` gem. But you can use gem `bcrypt` for password hashing. [This may be a useful resource](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#session) to help you get started.
2. A user authentication feature using OAuth. You may use the necessary gems here to help you achieve that; **OR** users have a concept of roles (e.g. admin vs regular users) along with simple authorization (eg. only admin can access all resources, only owner can edit resource).
3. A search/filter functionality (for e.g. search for users, search for products). You may use gems here. 
4. Integrate with at least 1 external API provider (for e.g. Twilio, Braintree, Google Maps, Facebook, Cloudinary). You may also use necessary gems here.
5. A working AJAX functionality.

**You will be expected to demonstrate good knowledge of your code during the code review session.**

### 2. App planning
Plan your app in Trello and add your lead mentor as a collaborator. Given the time frame, prioritize accordingly on the main features that you would like to focus on.

### 3. Initialize a Github repository and push your commits to it
Please **do not push** your commits to this repository. Initialize a new Github repository for your app.

### 4. Write some tests (required)
1. Write some model **validation** and **association** test (for e.g. uniqueness, presence, numericality).
2. Write at least 2 model specs, testing any custom model methods (test for happy and edgy paths).
3. Write at least 1 integration spec using the `Capybara` library.

### 5. Deploy your app to Heroku and ensure that your app is working as expected.

### 6. Submit your app
When you are done, *or* when the time's up, *git commit and git push* to your Github repo. Then, *put your Github _repo_ link and Herokuapp URL* in the Google Sheet at the end of this notice.

### 7. Schedule a time with us for a code review session.

During the code review session, you will be asked to demonstrate your app and explain your code.
